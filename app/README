Testing Notes
    There is currently no way to win.
    Reloading my viewFragment after losing causes issues.
        I think this is due to the way I swap Fragments
        The Fragment lifecycle is... strange
    Difficulty increases the number of flashes each "round"

 Animation Notes
    I placed the animators into an AnimatorSet
    I did this to get the total duration of the animations
        I think this breaks storing information in the Activity/Fragment requirement
        I really just wanted to see if this could work at all
    There is no change in animation speed with difficulty changes
        I wanted to do this without further breaking the no storing data in Fragments rule
        It seems ViewModel is the way to go about it
    The protection of turning the color buttons off while the animation plays is removed when starting again

  Resource/Source Notes
    I followed your Flashy example lectures when doing the animation.

  Questions
    What is the "safe" way to swap fragments?
    I have tried:
        .popBackStack()
        .replace()
        .saveInstanceState()
     And I cant seem to get the viewFragment to behave the same
